# Belly Button Challenge

This challenge is for building an interactive dashboard to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](https://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/) which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

The data retrieved contains metadata information of a person including an identifier, age, ethnicity and location.
The OTU data contains OTU id, OTU label and sample frequency for each person.

## Visualizations

### Dropdown
A dropdown is setup to select the test subjects

### Demographic info
The demographic section is updated with the info of the test subject

### OTU Bar chart
The OTU bar chart displays top 10 OTUs of the test subject selected.

### Bubble Chart
The bubbile chart displays the entire OTU dataset of a test subject, with OTU frequency determining the bubble size.

## Files

* index.html - HTML file\
* static/js/app.js - Java script file that contains logic to build the dynamic components of the dashboard
